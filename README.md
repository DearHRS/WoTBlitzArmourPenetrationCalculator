Currently updating over to c++
-new version will include gui but no plans to add models

log:15.04.2023 0115
-added module to handle input and other functions
-added module with functions related to blitz penetration physics
-modules barely interact with each other at the moment

log:15.04.2023 1516
-completed functions related to calculation of kinetic rounds (ap/apcr)
-intregated those functions and programme finally does calculations related to 100% chance of penetration

log:17.04.2023 1425
